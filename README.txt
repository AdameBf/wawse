-- Worms Armageddon Web Scheme Editor by LeTotalKiller --

Here is my scheme editor's source code.
Programming language used: PHP mainly, some JS too. HTML/CSS versions used: XHTML 1.0 and CSS 2.0.

>> Your help is welcome, especially with translations. They are in \includes\strings\ . Here's what you can and what you can't do: <<

- You can, of course, read the source-code (why would I put it on GitHub otherwise? :O).
- You can also fork me on GitHub and code improvements/translations -- you'll be mentioned in the source code (at least in comments).
- But you CAN'T redistribute the program somewhere else.
- And, of course, you can't steal my work and claim the editor is yours. Otherwise I'll probably slap you with a baguette. =)
